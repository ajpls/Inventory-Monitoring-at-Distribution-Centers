    "# Inventory Monitoring at Distribution Centers\n",
    "\n",
    "Inventory monitoring is an essential process at distribution centers. It involves counting inventory objects and ensures that the correct quantities are maintained to meet supply chain demands. There has been a great need to automate the process to meet the growing increase in consumer demand and eliminate errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution centers use robots to move objects in bins that can contain multiple objects. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved excellent results for object detection in images [1-4], text detection [5] vehicle detection [6] and many other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of this project were to:\n",
    "1. Use machine learning techniques to build a model that can classify the number of objects in each bin to assist in automating the inventory monitoring process [7].\n",
    "2. Demonstrate a machine learning engineering pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Set Up and Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS SageMaker, Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, Jupyter notebook, Python, PyTorch, and various software libraries were used. The necessary libraries were installed with the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In AWS SageMaker studio, the ml.t3.medium instance was used. It is low cost and has 2 vCPUs and 4 GiB\n",
    "memory therefore it has sufficient computing power for the project. It also has fast launch.\n",
    "The ml.g4dn.xlarge instance was used for faster performance to train the models in a container environment\n",
    "and model deployment. It has 1 GPU, 4 vCPUs and 16 GiB memory therefore it has sufficient computing\n",
    "power for training. It costs the lowest compared to the other GPU instances [8, 9]. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Jupyter Notebook</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The sagemaker.ipynb notebook was used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the data with the file_list.json file, explore it, and upload it to S3.\n",
    "2. Define estimators, the tuner, training containers, hyperparameters for hyperparameter tuning, rules and hooks for the debugger and profiler.\n",
    "3. Perform training jobs and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "4. Display the debugger profiling report and plot a debugger output.\n",
    "5. Deploy endpoints and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Script files</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "hpo.py was used for hyperparameter tuning. Different hyperparameters were used to train the model to find\n",
    "the best hyperparameters, which gave the lowest loss for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "train.py was used to train the model with the best hyperparameters and perform debugging and profiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "train_multi.py was used to perform multi-instance GPU model training. with the NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) backend, torch.nn.DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and the best hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The ABID [10] will be used to classify the number of objects in each bin. It contains over 500 000 JPEG images and the corresponding JSON metadata from bins of a pod in an Amazon Fulfillment Center (AFC).\n",
    "The bin images are captured as robots transport pods during normal AFC operations [10]. An example\n",
    "image (777.jpg) [11] and its corresponding metadata [12] are shown below.\n",

    "The distribution of the number of products per bin in the data subset is shown below. The range of the\n",

    "## Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "The ResNet50 [4] pre-trained PyTorch model [13] was used for the classification task because it has the best accuracy and speed, and a small model size when compared to other models [14] as shown in the Figure below from [14]. ResNet50 consists of 48 convolution layers, 1 max pooling layer and 1 average pooling layer. It has 3.8 billion FLOPs and is extensively used [4, 15]\n",

    "The following steps were required to complete the project:\n",
    "1. Data was obtained from a database and preprocessed.\n",
    "2. An initial model was trained with fixed hyperparameters to count the number of objects in an image and its accuracy and RMSE were measured.\n",
    "3. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to find the best hyperparameters to improve the model.\n",
    "4. A final model was trained with the best hyperparameters to count the number of objects in an image and its accuracy and RMSE were measured.\n",
    "5. Endpoints were deployed and queried with images to make predictions.\n",
    "6. Performance of the model was evaluated and validated by comparing it to a benchmark.\n",
    "7. Multi-instance GPU training was performed. \n",

    "\n",
    "The Cross - entropy loss is shown above. It is difficult to determine if the model is learning because\n",
    "of the numerous oscillations. These are likely due to the small batch size [19] or outliers [20]. If a larger\n",
    "batch size is used and the outliers are removed, the training curve may smooth out, and show a decrease in\n",
    "loss, which indicates the model is learning. This maybe the case, as the training loss decreases from about\n",
    "1.65 to 1.45, and the cross validation loss decreases from about 1.33 to 1.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvement\n",
    "Low quality images such as images with occlusions, unclear or blurry images and images where the contents\n",
    "of the bin images do not match the inventory record, could be removed to improve performance. This\n",
    "would have been very time - consuming if performed manually. An automated method would be better.\n",
    "Training on a larger dataset may improve performance. Tuning with more training jobs may result in better\n",
    "hyperparameters. Large batch sizes may prevent oscillations. The network architecture that was added onto\n",
    "the pre-trained model for fine-tuning could be modified. The number of input and output features, in the\n",
    "fully connected layers and the number of layers could be modified. Alternative pre-trained models such as\n",
    "EfficientNet, Inception and VGG [21] could be tried.\n",
